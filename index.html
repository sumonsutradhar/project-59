        <p class="para"> My hobby is drawing.I mostly draw pictures of people, animals and birds. I use crayons, pencils, colour pencils etc to draw pictures. During birthdays of my parents, sister and friends, I gift my best drawings to them. I spend my free time drawing pictures. I got first prize in my school for the drawing competition. I love drawing girls with different hair styles. The hair styles i know are plaits, two sides, ponytail etc. I like to draw the sunset the most. I love drawing. I like to become an artist when I grow up.
